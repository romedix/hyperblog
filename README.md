An incredible blog for the course of [Git](https://www.google.com "Git") and [Github](https://www.google.com "Github")
> Platzi's Git and Github course was something missing in my carreer to increase my salary and getting in touch with Machine Learning.

## In this course we will learn a lot:
* All Git commands
* Github workflow
* The true love for good practices
* Very crazy tricks by the teacher

as a reminder: **This readme.md is a joke** Disigned as an example. visit [Platzi](https://www.platzi.com "Platzi") and view the course.
